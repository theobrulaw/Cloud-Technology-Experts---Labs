Lab: Create and Manage an S3 Bucket in AWS
Objective
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
Create and configure an Amazon S3 bucket.


Upload and manage objects.


Set bucket permissions and policies.


Enable versioning and understand its purpose.


Access your bucket via AWS CLI.



Prerequisites
An AWS Account (Free Tier is fine).


A configured IAM user with AmazonS3FullAccess permissions.


Basic understanding of AWS regions and S3 storage classes.



Lab Sections
Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console
Go to https://aws.amazon.com/console/.


Log in using your IAM user credentials (not the root account).


From the Services menu, select S3 under “Storage”.



Step 2: Create a New S3 Bucket (Console)
Click “Create bucket”.


Bucket name: Must be globally unique. Example:

 my-first-s3-lab-bucket-damian

Region: Choose a region close to you (e.g., us-east-1).


Block Public Access settings:


Leave all boxes checked to block public access (recommended for private buckets).


For testing a static website, you can uncheck “Block all public access” — but only do this in a non-production environment.


Bucket Versioning:


Enable Versioning to keep multiple versions of objects (optional but recommended for this lab).


Encryption:


Choose Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3).


Scroll down and click Create bucket.


✅ Your bucket is now created.

Step 3: Upload Files to the Bucket
Click the bucket name to open it.


Click Upload → Add files → Choose any local file (e.g., a .txt or .jpg).


Click Upload.


Once uploaded, you’ll see your object in the bucket list.

Step 4: Test Object Access and Permissions
Click on the uploaded file.


Under Object URL, copy the link.


Open the link in a browser — if public access is blocked, you’ll see:

 AccessDenied

(Optional) To make an object public:


Select the object → Actions → Make public using ACL.


Reopen the object URL — you should now see the content.


⚠️ Only make files public when you understand the security implications.

Step 5: Enable Bucket Versioning (if not already enabled)
Go to your bucket’s Properties tab.


Scroll to Bucket Versioning → click Edit → Enable versioning.


Save changes.


Now, if you upload a new file with the same name, the old version remains stored and retrievable.
To view:
Go to Objects → click Show versions.



Step 6: Create a Folder (Prefix)
In S3, folders are actually key prefixes.
In your bucket, click Create folder.


Enter name: project-files/


Upload files into this folder to see how S3 organizes them using key paths.



Step 7: Apply a Bucket Policy (Optional)
To make the entire bucket publicly readable (⚠️ for demo only):
Go to Permissions → Bucket policy.


Paste the following (replace the bucket name):

 {
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-first-s3-lab-bucket-damian/*"
    }
  ]
}

Save changes and confirm warning.


Now you can access objects via their URLs.



Key Takeaways
S3 is object storage, not block or file storage.


Buckets are global namespace — bucket names must be unique.


Versioning helps recover from accidental deletions.


Bucket policies and ACLs control access.


AWS CLI is essential for automation and scriptin
